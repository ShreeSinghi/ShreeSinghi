## 🏆 Featured Projects & Publications

* **[The Log-Diffusion Solver: Stabilizing Heat Diffusion on Discrete Meshes](https://summergeometry.org/sgi2025/the-log-diffusion-solver/)**
    * *MIT Summer Geometry Initiative (SGI) Research*
    * Developed a novel PDE solver for heat diffusion on discrete mesh surfaces in the log-domain, providing enhanced numerical stability and including a formal proof of convergence.
* **[Mesh Fairing: Energy Minimization for Mesh Smoothing](github.com/ShreeSinghi/sgi_mesh_fairing_blog)**
    * *MIT Summer Geometry Initiative (SGI) Research*
    * Implemented and demonstrated surface fairing via energy minimization. Used a composite energy function combining Spring, Bending, and Angle Terms to effectively remove noise and improve triangle quality in crumpled 3D meshes.
* **[DINOHash: Learning Adversarially Robust Perceptual Hashes](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HrGa8Mq2NE)**
    * *ICML '25 CODEML Workshop*
    * The first open-sourced, adversarially robust Deep Learning perceptual hashing model.
* **[Riemann Sum Optimization for Accurate Integrated Gradients Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04118)**
    * *NeurIPS '24 IAI Workshop*
    * A novel framework that reduces computational costs for Integrated Gradient methods.
* **[Strengthening Interpretability: An Investigative Study of Integrated Gradient Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09043)**
    * *TMLR '24*
    * Reproduced and extended the IDGI framework, correcting errors and conducting sensitivity analysis to identify conditions for improved attribution stability.
